# pix2pix – Image-to-Image Translation (cGAN)

This project implements pix2pix using PyTorch. It supports:
- paired datasets
- side-by-side datasets
- training, testing, and a Flask demo server

## 🚀 Train the model

=======
# Task3-Prodigy
This project implements an image-to-image translation model using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), commonly known as Pix2Pix. The model learns how to transform an input image into a desired output image by training on paired datasets.
